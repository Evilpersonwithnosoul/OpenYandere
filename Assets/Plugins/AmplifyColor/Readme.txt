Description

  Amplify Color, previously known as Color3 Advanced Grading, brings industry-level 
  color grading to your game by mimicking the color transforms made inside a tool 
  like Photoshop; e.g. change contrast, color curves, exposure, saturation, hue and 
  more, or a combination of all transforms at once. So fast, it runs on mobile.
